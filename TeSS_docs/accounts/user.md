# User account creation

A TeSS instance is viewable by everyone, you do not need to register to search or browse for materials. 
The materials that TeSS points to may be restricted-access, but the registry itself is open.
If you want to register your materials, you can register for a user account.

```{admonition} Note for mutli-space TeSS instances

If a TeSS instanace has multiple [spaces](../spaces/intro-spaces), please register one user account for all spaces. 
For security reasons, you will need to log in to each space separately, even though you are using the same account.
