# Provider account creation

Content providers are entities (such as academic institutions, non-profit organisations, portals) that provide training materials of relevance to your community. 
Every event or training material in TeSS is associated with precisely one content provider. 

Each content provider has the following properties:

* Title, URL, description, logo, keywords
* One of three types: Organisation, Project, Portal
* One or more approved editors (TeSS user accounts)
