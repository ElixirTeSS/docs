## Widgets
Widgets are chunks of javascript code that can be copied into website source code to display TeSS content. There are several different styles and functionalities available from our configurable widget suite. Widgets can be used to enhance your site and offer your community lists of relevant events or training resources.

## API

TeSS has a fully functioning JSON API. You can explore our JSON-API by appending .json_api to the end of the URL of most pages (excluding parameters). For example:

```
https://tess.elixir-europe.org/events.json_api
https://tess.elixir-europe.org/materials.json_api?scientific_topics=RNA-Seq
https://tess.elixir-europe.org/content_providers.json_api
https://tess.elixir-europe.org/workflows.json_api
```

The full documentation for the TeSS JSON API can be found here:
