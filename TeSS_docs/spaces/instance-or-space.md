# When to choose your own TeSS instance or register a space in TeSSHub

TeSS is an open source, reusable software platform, and has been [deployed by several other communities across the globe](../overview/global). However, with the launch of the [Spaces feature](intro-spaces), it is possible for a community to create their own tailored catalogue or "view" within an existing TeSS instance. The TeSSHub is a public instance that supports the Spaces feature (launching soon).


## Why register a space with TeSSHub?

- {fas}`clipboard-check;sd-text-success` Appears as its own distinct catalogue
- {fas}`clipboard-check;sd-text-success` Can exchange materials with other TeSS instances and spaces
- {fas}`clipboard-check;sd-text-success` Support from the global TeSS community
- {fas}`clipboard-check;sd-text-success` Open and public to run and use[^freespace]
- {fas}`clipboard-check;sd-text-success` No installation or server required
- {fas}`clipboard-question;sd-text-warning`  Limited technical customisation options  


## Why create your own TeSS instance?

- {fas}`clipboard-check;sd-text-success` Appears as its own distinct catalogue

[^freespace]: The TeSSHub does not charge for space creation but is dependent on overall funding. Other multi-space TeSS instances may vary.
