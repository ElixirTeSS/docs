# When to choose your own TeSS instance or register a space in TeSSHub

TeSS is an open source, reusable software platform, and has been [deployed by several other communities across the globe](../overview/tess#global-instances-of-tess). However, with the launch of the [Spaces feature](intro-spaces), it is possible for a community to create their own tailored catalogue or "view" within an existing TeSS instance. The TeSSHub is a public instance that supports the Spaces feature (launching soon).
