# How to credit TeSS when you make your own instance

You are welcome to use the TeSS platform software however you like within the terms of its licence. 
However, we have an extensive community of users and developers which you are welcome to join. They can offer you support and guidance throughout the setup process and thereafter.

If you are maintaining an instance of TeSS, or thinking of doing so, please [contact us](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/about/us#contact). We will help you to effectively credit the TeSS developers and community.
