# Definitions

Definitions of terms and user roles used across TeSS.

## Overall terms and concepts 

Definition of common terms used across TeSS, sorted alphabetically.

```{glossary}

Collection
    Collections can be thought of as folders in which users may collect particular training materials or events, from the full catalogue available within TeSS to address their specific training needs. 
    See [Collections in TeSS](../content/collections) for details.

Content provider
    Entities (such as academic institutions, non-profit organisations, portals) that provide training materials of relevance.

e-Learning
    e-Learning materials are curated materials focused on e-Learning. 

ELIXIR TeSS Portal
    The [ELIXIR TeSS](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/) portal, the training registry for Europe's distributed infrastructure for life-science data, is built using the TeSS Platform.

Event
    An event in TeSS is a link to a single training event sourced by a provider along with description and other meta information (e.g. date, location, audience, ontological categorization, keywords).
    
    Training events can be added manually or automatically harvested from a provider's website.

Exchange (TeSS-X)
    If a community runs its own instance then a TeSS-X plugin sets up an exchange with other instances.
    In the mTeSS-X project, we will show how several TeSS-instance catalogues exchange nominated training resources. 
    See [What do we mean by eXchange?](https://elixirtess.github.io/mTeSS-X/exchange) on the mTeSS-X project website for details.

Instance
    One installation of the TeSS Platform, on a server, managed by a technical administrator. An instance may have multiple spaces, if this option has been enabled by the administrator.
    
    Examples of TeSS instances can be viewed on the [global usages page](global).

Learning path
    A a pathway that guides learners through a set of modules (courses/materials) to be undertaken progressively (from lower- to higher-order thinking skills) to acquire the desired knowledge and skills on a subject by the end of the pathway. 
    See [Learning paths in TeSS](../content/learning-paths) for details.

mTeSS-X 
    The [mTeSS-X Project](mtess-x) (Multi-space Training e-Support System with eXchange) overcomes the fragmentation of training resources across Research Infrastructures and the European Science Clusters.
    The project aims to enhance existing TeSS-based training registries or catalogues like [ELIXIR TeSS (life sciences)](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/) and [PaN-Training (photon and neutron)](https://www.panosc.eu/training-catalogue/) by building an aggregator for these and similar platforms.

Space (mTeSS)
    A single TeSS instance can present multiple tailored spaces (catalogues) whose selections of training material are “views” on a global catalogue. 
    Each community registers, maintains and curates their material for their members in their own virtual space in the common portal environment.
    See [Introduction to spaces](../spaces/intro-spaces) for details.

TeSSHub
    The platform name for a TeSS instance with multiple [spaces](#term-Space-mTeSS) 
    that can [exchange](#term-Exchange-TeSS-X) materials with other instances.
    The TeSSHub is one of the outputs from the mTeSS-X project, 
    where [ELIXIR TeSS (life sciences)](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/) 
    and [PaN-Training (photon and neutron)](https://www.panosc.eu/training-catalogue/) 
    will be running multipe spaces from the same server, appearing as distinct catalogues, 
    and can share relevant materials. 
    
    Communities may be welcome to [request their own space](../spaces/instance-or-space/)
    on a TeSSHub, providing them with their own registry, 
    without the need to host and maintain their own instance.  

TeSS Platform
    The main codebase which is used for development, written in Ruby on Rails. The code is open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ElixirTeSS/TeSS) under a BSD 3-Clause licence. 

Training material
    In the context of TeSS, a training material is a link to a single online training material sourced by a content provider (such as a text on a Web page, presentation, video) along with description and other meta information (e.g. ontological categorization, keywords).
    
    Materials can be added manually or automatically harvested from a provider's website.
    
Workflow
    Training workflows in TeSS are visual, step-by-step protocols that allow users to navigate materials in TeSS in topic- or task-related ways. 
    For example, they may encapsulate typical stages of particular kinds of data analysis (protein sequence analysis, structure analysis, etc.), where each stage/node in the workflow represents a given analysis step and links to the corresponding training resources. 
    See [Workflows in TeSS](../content/workflows) for details.
