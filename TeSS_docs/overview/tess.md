# Introduction to TeSS

## Training e-Support Service (TeSS)


TeSS is a platform that was developed to provide a one-stop shop for trainers and trainees to discover online information and content, including training materials, events and interactive tutorials. 
For training providers, TeSS provides opportunities to promote training events and news, and to contribute to a growing catalogue of materials; 
for trainers, the portal offers an environment for sharing materials and event information; 
for trainees, it offers a convenient gateway via which to identify relevant training events and resources, and to perform specific, guided analysis tasks via customised training workflows.

The [mTeSS-X Project](https://elixirtess.github.io/mTeSS-X) (Multi-space Training e-Support System with eXchange) overcomes the fragmentation of training resources across Research Infrastructures and the European Science Clusters. 
The project aims to enhance existing TeSS-based training registries or catalogues like [ELIXIR TeSS (life sciences)](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/) and [PaN-Training (photon and neutron)](https://www.panosc.eu/training-catalogue/) by building an aggregator for these and similar platforms.

TeSS was originally developed as part of [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/), Europe's distributed infrastructure for life-science data. 
One of the goals of ELIXIR is to train research scientists to better use available computational infrastructures to address critical research questions. 
This requires access both to face-to-face training opportunities and to disparate training materials and resources, currently dispersed across Europe.

## Global instances of TeSS

TeSS is an open source, reusable software platform, and has been deployed by several other communities across the globe.
