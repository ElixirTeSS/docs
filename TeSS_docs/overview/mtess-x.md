**Scaling training portal federation for RIs through Multi-tenanting and Exchange**

To overcome fragmentation of training resources across Research Infrastructures (RIs)
and the Science Clusters, the mTeSS-X project aims to enhance the existing
[ELIXIR TeSS platform](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/about) &mdash;
to build an aggregator for training portals like ELIXIR TeSS and
[PaNOSC training portals](https://www.panosc.eu/training-catalogue/)
&mdash; to natively support federation.

Such a fully-featured open-source multi-tenanted training platform is expected to be an 
innovation for building a federation of portals to:

- help break down barriers between thematic communities,
- promote a more cohesive European research community,
- and promote FAIR and open training.

The project strives to support the federation of training catalogues using a multi-tenancy approach, and enabling cross-instance content exchange. This will allow RIs and their communities to maintain tailored catalogues with distinct identities, while simultaneously benefiting from a shared global pool of resources.
