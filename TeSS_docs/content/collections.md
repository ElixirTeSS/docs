# Collections in TeSS

## What is a collection?

Collections can be thought of as folders in which users may collect particular training materials or events, from the full catalogue available within TeSS to address their specific training needs. Collections are visible to the public by default. 
The Collections feature must be enabled by the site administrator. 

```{admonition} Examples of collections can be seen on the following instances of TeSS:

* [Collections on ELIXIR TeSS](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/collections)
* [Collections on Taxila](https://taxila.nl/collections)
```

## Creating collections

Steps to create a collection:

1. On the 'Collections' tab, click the 'Create collection' button at the top-right.
2. Give the collection a title (required), description, image and keywords.
3. The collection will be public by default. Un-ticking the 'Public' box will hide this collection from anyone who isn't the creator or a collaborator.
4. To add a training material to the collection, click in the ‘Add a new material’ box and begin to type its name. Select the correct material. You can provide a comment to be displayed with the material, if you wish to provide additional context or explain which parts of the material are relevant to the collection.
5. Repeat step 4 to add multiple materials for this collection.
6. To add an event to the collection, click in the ‘Add a new event’ box and begin to type its name. Select the correct event.  You can provide a comment.
7. Repeat step 6 to add multiple materials for this collection.
8. You can reorder the materials and events using the arrow icons.
9. When you have finished, click the ‘Create Collection’ button.

1. Navigate to the page for that collection.
2. Click the ‘Collaborators’ button at the top-right of the page.
3. Start to type the name or username of the collaborator you wish to add and select them. The collaborator needs to be a registered user of TeSS.
4. Repeat for any additional collaborators.
5. When you have finished, click the ‘Done’ button.


### Updating collections

To update a collection, you need to be the owner or a collaborator:

1. Navigate to the page for that collection. 
2. Click the ‘Edit’ button at the top-right of the page.
3. Make your changes then click the ‘Update Collection’ button at the bottom.
4. If you wish to delete the collection, use the ‘Delete’ button next to the ‘Edit’ button on the page for that item.


## Viewing collections

Collections can be browsed and searched in TeSS. They are organised by keyword.

1. To view the collections, click ‘Collections’ in the main menu. (Tip: To view a collection you do not need to be logged in to TeSS.)
2. Click to view a collection. Read the summary box. The details of the included training materials and events appear in two tabs; click each item to open it. Information about the collection appears on the left.
3. Events that have passed will not be shown by default. If there are passed events, this is indicated by an asterisk next to the number of events.
