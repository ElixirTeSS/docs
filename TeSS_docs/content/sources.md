# Sources

Owners and editors of content providers in TeSS can register and manage Sources to be automatically ingested. A source consists of a URL for TeSS to fetch, and an "ingestion method" - which hints to TeSS how the contents of the URL should be processed.

Once registered, a source will need to be approved by an administrator before it is active, but can be tested to see exactly what metadata TeSS can extract from the source.

To register a source, click the "Sources" tab on your content provider page, or if you have not yet registered a content provider, see our page [Provider account creation](../accounts/provider).

Currently available user-managed ingestion methods:

- Bioschemas

For other methods, please [contact us](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/about/us#contact) to discuss how to register your content automatically in TeSS.
